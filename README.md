### PYTHON SCRAPER

I am building a simple python scraper in order to faciliate a future project I have in mind.
Starting small and getting comfortable with coding again after a long absence is the goal.

I began this project by working through the following guide:
[Web Scraping Basics](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/)

The files directly linked to this guide are mathematicians_rank.py and quick-html-example.py.

The guide seemed to be outdated as their source page did not appear to be constructed in the same way as it was outlined
in the article.

### DEPENDCIES
requests for performing HTTP requests

BeautifulSoup4 for handling HTML processing

### ISSUES
The issues that I want to resolve are logged within the test suite for the moment.
Immediately I can tell that it's incredibly slow which needs to be addressed.
